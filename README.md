## OVERVIEW

Keyboard represents a KeyBoard event. KeyBoard actions are performed by using low-level interface which allows us to provide virtualized device input to the web browser.
A Keyboard Event describes a user's interaction with the keyboard. When a user presses single or multiple keys, keyboard events generate. Selenium provides various ways to automate these Keyboard Events.

### Keyboard Events

1) Key Down -  The keyDown is used to simulate action of depressing a key.
2) Key Up - The keyUp is used to simulate key-up (or) key-release action.
3) Send Keys - This is a convenience method in the Actions API that combines keyDown and keyUp commands in one action. Executing this command differs slightly from using the element method.
